# finding_disk_galaxies_research

Code for generating images from FITS data for use in a public galaxy categorization effort. Adapted by Dylan Bateman, Undergraduate studying Physics at the University of Missouri, from code made available by Min-Su Shin at https://astromsshin.github.io/science/code/Python_fits_image/index.html.

### small_sample

    - Folder containing raw FITS data, as well as information about the projects goals and methods by the project head, Vicky Kuhn.

### small_sample_collage

    - Folder contains collages of each sample, containing each filter as well as an RGB composition and an extra panel showing the rest frame of the sample a second time.

### small_sample_converted

    - Folder contains individual .png images of each filter in each scaling mode available via img_scale.py.

### small_sample_RGBComp

    - Folder contains test images containing the R, G, and B channels of the RGB composition, and then 3 RGB comps with different scaling methods for the channels.
